================================================================================
THE CORE QUESTION:
================================================================================

"Does 'Our Approach' page tell a cohesive narrative, and what is its unique role 
in the site system compared to Residential Program, Home, and Mission & Vision?"

================================================================================
ANSWER: YES, BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT REDUNDANCY THAT NEEDS ADDRESSING
================================================================================

THE NARRATIVE OF "OUR APPROACH" PAGE:
--------------------------------------

FLOW:
Hero → Philosophy (whole person) → Evidence-based therapies → Holistic therapies 
→ Individualized approach → Nature's role → Family support → FAQ → CTA

EMOTIONAL ARC:
Establishes values → Shows clinical rigor → Shows holistic balance → Personalizes 
→ Contextualizes environment → Addresses family → Removes barriers → Converts

WHAT IT DOES WELL:
1. Balances clinical credibility (CBT/DBT/REBT) with holistic warmth
2. Uses specific therapy names to build trust
3. Includes REBT (Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy) - UNIQUE to this page
4. Nature section provides context for Costa Rica location
5. Family support shows comprehensive approach

WHAT UNDERMINES THE NARRATIVE:
1. Repeats exact same therapies as Residential Program
2. Repeats "whole person: mind, body, spirit" verbatim from 3 other pages
3. "Your Unique Recovery Path" section feels inserted, not integral
4. "Support for Loved Ones" doesn't fit "Our Approach" - belongs on Residential/Preparing

================================================================================
CONTENT REDUNDANCY MATRIX (ACTUAL QUOTES)
================================================================================

PHRASE: "Whole person—mind, body, and spirit"
- HOME (OurFoundation): ✓
- RESIDENTIAL (Program Overview): ✓ "addresses all aspects of your well-being—mind, body, and spirit"
- OUR APPROACH (Personalized Approach): ✓ "true recovery addresses the whole person—mind, body, and spirit"
- MISSION & VISION (Mission): ✓ "treating the whole person—mind, body, and spirit"

VERDICT: Appears on 4 pages. Brand pillar, but overused.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHRASE: "Evidence-based + holistic"
- HOME (Welcome, OurFoundation): ✓ "evidence-based treatments with holistic practices"
- RESIDENTIAL (Program Overview): ✓ "evidence-based therapies with complementary holistic practices"
- OUR APPROACH (Hero): ✓ "Combining Evidence-Based Practices & Holistic Healing"
- OUR APPROACH (Personalized): ✓ "evidence-based treatments with holistic practices"
- MISSION & VISION: ✓ "evidence-based treatment combined with holistic practices"

VERDICT: Core value proposition, but becomes meaningless through repetition.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================
WHAT EACH PAGE ACTUALLY DOES
================================================================================

HOME PAGE:
---------
PURPOSE: First impression, build trust, drive immediate action
NARRATIVE: "We're different (Recovery Reimagined) → Here's our foundation → 
Here are our services → Here are our therapies → Here's how to start"

UNIQUE CONTENT:
- Main Services Carousel: Detox, 30/60/90-day overview, Holistic, Family, Aftercare
- Treatment Types Expandable: 6 clickable therapies with detailed explanations
- How To Get Started: 3-step process
- FAQ: 10 practical questions (cost, insurance, daily schedule, family visits, safety, what to bring, co-occurring disorders, what makes us different, phone access)
- "Recovery Reimagined" positioning
- Focus on ACCESSIBLE pricing ("accessible investment")

CONVERSION FOCUS: Multiple CTAs, phone number prominent, "Start Your Journey"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM PAGE:
-------------------------
PURPOSE: Explain WHAT the program is, HOW it works, WHAT you'll experience
NARRATIVE: "Experiential Healing → What is it? → Choose your length → 
Here are the therapies → Here's your daily life → Here's the investment"

UNIQUE CONTENT:
- LayoutGrid component: Visual, interactive 30/60/90-day + Aftercare cards
  with detailed descriptions of each length
- Daily Schedule: Hour-by-hour breakdown (6am wake up → 9pm lights out)
- Investment section: Transparent pricing discussion
- "What is the Residential Program?" framing
- Focus on STRUCTURE and EXPERIENCE
- Program Lengths as a major decision point

CONVERSION FOCUS: "Take Back Your Life", "Start Your Recovery Today"

KEY STRENGTH: The LayoutGrid and Daily Schedule are TANGIBLE and PRACTICAL.
You can visualize your life here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OUR APPROACH PAGE:
------------------
PURPOSE: (Currently unclear - appears to be explaining treatment philosophy)
NARRATIVE: "Holistic + Evidence-based → Whole person → Here are clinical therapies → 
Here are holistic therapies → Individualized → Nature's role → Family involvement"

UNIQUE CONTENT:
- REBT therapy (only page that mentions it)
- "Participant-centered model" language (not just "personalized")
- Extended nature section with waterfall image
- Support for Loved Ones section

CONVERSION FOCUS: Weakest of the three - only 1 mid-page CTA (to Residential)

KEY WEAKNESS: Feels like it's trying to explain "what we do" when Residential 
already does that. The narrative arc is muddled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MISSION & VISION PAGE:
----------------------
PURPOSE: Establish organizational values, build emotional connection
NARRATIVE: "Our mission → Our vision → Our values → FAQ → CTA"

UNIQUE CONTENT:
- Mission statement (why we exist)
- Vision statement (where we're going)
- 6 Core Values: Compassion, Integrity, Excellence, Community, Innovation, Empowerment
- Philosophical, not tactical

CONVERSION FOCUS: "Start Your Journey Today"

KEY STRENGTH: Clear purpose - WHO we are as an organization

================================================================================
USER JOURNEY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

IDEAL USER JOURNEY #1 (Research-oriented):
Home → Mission & Vision → Residential Program → Contact
Home → About → Team/Facility → Residential Program → Contact

PROBLEM: Where does "Our Approach" fit?
If someone goes Home → Residential Program, they get all the therapy info.
If someone goes Home → Approach → Residential, they see duplicate therapy lists.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDEAL USER JOURNEY #2 (Urgent/crisis):
Home → Contact
Home → Get Help → Contact

PROBLEM: "Our Approach" isn't in this journey at all.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IDEAL USER JOURNEY #3 (Comparing programs):
Home → Residential Program → Review lengths → Contact

PROBLEM: "Our Approach" doesn't help with comparison.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHERE "OUR APPROACH" MIGHT FIT:

JOURNEY A: Skeptical visitor who needs clinical credibility
Home → "Do they use real therapies?" → Our Approach → Residential Program → Contact

JOURNEY B: Holistic-oriented visitor
Home → "Is this just woo-woo or real treatment?" → Our Approach → Residential Program

JOURNEY C: SEO visitor searching "addiction treatment approach"
Google "addiction treatment approach Costa Rica" → Our Approach page → Residential → Contact

VERDICT: Approach page serves visitors who need to understand the METHODOLOGY
before they want to know the LOGISTICS.

But currently, it duplicates the methodology content from Residential.

================================================================================
THE REAL ISSUE: RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM PAGE DOES TWO JOBS
================================================================================

RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM CURRENTLY COVERS:
1. What the program IS (structure, logistics)
2. What therapies we USE (methodology)
3. How your day looks (experience)
4. How long you'll stay (program lengths)
5. How much it costs (investment)

That's a LOT for one page.

"OUR APPROACH" COULD TAKE OVER:
- What therapies we use (methodology)
- Why these therapies work (clinical philosophy)
- How we integrate evidence-based + holistic (the approach itself)

BUT THEN RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM WOULD NEED:
- Just the structure/logistics/experience
- Program lengths (already has this well with LayoutGrid)
- Daily schedule (already has this)
- Pricing (already has this)

ALTERNATIVE: DELETE "OUR APPROACH" AND KEEP RESIDENTIAL AS IS.

Residential Program is comprehensive and works as a standalone page.
Approach page adds limited unique value (only REBT is unique).

================================================================================
CONTENT GAPS & MISSING CONNECTIONS
================================================================================

GAPS IDENTIFIED:

1. NO PAGE EXPLAINS "TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE"
   - Residential lists it as a modality
   - Approach doesn't mention it
   - This is a differentiator that needs explanation

2. NO PAGE EXPLAINS "PARTICIPANT-CENTERED MODEL"
   - Approach mentions it but doesn't explain what it means in practice
   - Is this different from "personalized"? If so, how?

3. FAMILY SUPPORT IS FRAGMENTED
   - Appears on Home (Main Services Carousel)
   - Appears on Residential (as a feature)
   - Appears on Approach (Support for Loved Ones section)
   - Should probably be ONE comprehensive section on Residential or its own page

4. NATURE'S ROLE IS UNDEREXPLAINED
   - Approach has "Healing Through Nature" section
   - But it's brief and doesn't convey the POWER of Costa Rica's environment
   - This is a major differentiator vs. US/Canada rehabs

5. "PREPARING FOR YOUR STAY" PAGE DOESN'T EXIST YET
   - This is the third Programs dropdown item
   - It should cover: what to bring, travel logistics, what to expect on Day 1, admin requirements
   - This would complete the Programs dropdown trilogy

MISSING CONNECTIONS:

- Approach page links to Residential ("Learn More About Our Programs")
- Residential doesn't link back to Approach
- Approach doesn't link to Preparing For Your Stay (doesn't exist yet)
- No page links to Team (to meet the therapists who deliver "our approach")

================================================================================
SEO KEYWORD ANALYSIS
================================================================================

RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM likely targets:
- "residential addiction treatment"
- "inpatient rehab Costa Rica"
- "30 day rehab program"
- "90 day addiction treatment"
- "Costa Rica rehab program"

OUR APPROACH likely targets:
- "addiction treatment approach"
- "holistic addiction treatment"
- "evidence-based rehab"
- "CBT addiction treatment"
- "trauma-informed addiction treatment"

PROBLEM: Both pages target "holistic addiction treatment" and "evidence-based"
This is keyword cannibalization - Google won't know which to rank.

FIX:
- Residential should own transactional keywords (program length, residential treatment)
- Approach should own informational keywords (how does treatment work, what is trauma-informed care)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION: OPTION C (DIFFERENTIATE) - WITH MODIFICATIONS
================================================================================

KEEP "OUR APPROACH" PAGE BUT COMPLETELY REWRITE IT:

NEW PURPOSE:
Explain the CLINICAL PHILOSOPHY and METHODOLOGY in depth for research-oriented 
visitors who need to understand the "why" and "how" before the "what."

NEW STRUCTURE:

1. HERO: "Trauma-Informed, Participant-Centered Care"
   Subtitle: "Understanding the clinical methodology that makes recovery possible"

2. TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE (NEW SECTION - currently missing)
   - What is trauma-informed care?
   - Why do we screen for trauma?
   - How does trauma intersect with addiction?
   - The 6 pillars: Safety, Transparency, Peer Support, Planning Together, Empowerment, Cultural Awareness
   (Note: This content already exists in approach-page-copy.txt!)

3. PARTICIPANT-CENTERED MODEL (EXPAND EXISTING)
   - What does "participant-centered" mean in practice?
   - How is it different from traditional "doctor-knows-best" models?
   - Your voice in treatment planning
   - Empowerment vs. compliance

4. EVIDENCE-BASED FOUNDATION (STREAMLINE)
   - REMOVE the list of therapies (already on Residential)
   - KEEP: "We use proven, validated therapies"
   - ADD: Link to Residential for full therapy list
   - FOCUS: Why do we use multiple modalities instead of one approach?

5. HOLISTIC INTEGRATION (STREAMLINE)
   - REMOVE the list of holistic practices (already on Residential)
   - KEEP: Philosophy of why holistic matters
   - ADD: How do we integrate evidence-based + holistic? (Not just list them)
   - FOCUS: The science of mind-body connection

6. THE COSTA RICA DIFFERENCE (EXPAND NATURE SECTION)
   - Why does environment matter for addiction recovery?
   - Pura Vida lifestyle as therapeutic
   - Weekly nature excursions as therapy (not just recreation)
   - Research on nature + recovery outcomes

7. OUTCOMES & RESEARCH (NEW SECTION)
   - What does success look like?
   - How do we measure progress?
   - Follow-up and aftercare data
   - This adds CREDIBILITY that's currently missing

8. MEET OUR CLINICAL TEAM (NEW SECTION)
   - Link to Team page
   - "Our approach is only as good as the people delivering it"
   - Highlight: Dr. Alfaro (psychiatrist), Sharon (psychologist), therapists

9. FAQ (KEEP BUT REFOCUS)
   - Current: What holistic methods? Is program individualized? Do you offer detox?
   - New: What is trauma-informed care? How do you personalize treatment? What outcomes do you track?

10. CTA: "Experience Our Approach" → Link to Residential Program

RESULT:
- Approach page becomes the "WHY" (clinical philosophy, methodology, outcomes)
- Residential page becomes the "WHAT" (structure, schedule, lengths, pricing)
- Preparing page becomes the "HOW" (logistics, packing, travel, Day 1)

Three pages, three distinct purposes, no duplication.

================================================================================
ALTERNATIVE: DELETE "OUR APPROACH" PAGE
================================================================================

PROS:
- Eliminates redundancy immediately
- Residential Program is already comprehensive
- Simplifies site navigation
- Forces focus on conversion pages (Home → Residential → Contact)

CONS:
- Loses potential SEO page for "approach" keywords
- Loses space to explain trauma-informed care and participant-centered model
- Makes Programs dropdown only 2 items (Residential, Preparing)
- Misses opportunity to serve research-oriented visitors

VERDICT: Deletion is the easy answer, but it's not the best answer.
Better to differentiate and make Approach page truly valuable.

================================================================================
FINAL ANSWER TO ORIGINAL QUESTION
================================================================================

Q: "Does 'Our Approach' page tell a cohesive narrative?"

A: YES, but it's weakened by redundancy. The narrative arc itself is logical:
Philosophy → Clinical rigor → Holistic balance → Personalization → Context → Support

Q: "What is its role in the complete system?"

A: CURRENTLY: Muddled. It duplicates Residential Program's therapy content.

SHOULD BE: The "WHY" page - explaining clinical philosophy, trauma-informed care, 
participant-centered model, and the methodology that makes the Residential Program effective.

Q: "Should we keep it?"

A: YES, but rewrite it completely using Option C (Differentiate).
Focus on trauma-informed care, participant-centered model, outcomes, and clinical 
philosophy - NOT therapy lists.

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

1. REWRITE "OUR APPROACH" PAGE
   - Add Trauma-Informed Care section (content exists in approach-page-copy.txt)
   - Expand Participant-Centered Model section
   - REMOVE therapy lists (CBT, DBT, etc.) - just reference Residential
   - ADD Outcomes & Research section
   - LINK to Team page
   - Refocus FAQ on methodology questions

2. UPDATE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM PAGE
   - Keep as-is for now (it's working well)
   - Ensure it owns all therapy lists
   - Add a small section: "Want to understand our clinical approach? Learn about our methodology" 
     with link to Approach page

3. BUILD "PREPARING FOR YOUR STAY" PAGE
   - Complete the Programs dropdown
   - What to bring / Travel logistics / Day 1 / Admin requirements
   - Distinct from both Approach (why) and Residential (what)

4. REDUCE "WHOLE PERSON: MIND, BODY, SPIRIT" REPETITION
   - Keep on Mission & Vision (it's our mission)
   - Keep on Home (it's our introduction)
   - REMOVE from Residential (replace with "holistic approach addresses all aspects")
   - REMOVE from Approach (replace with more specific language)

5. FIX SEO CANNIBALIZATION
   - Residential targets: "residential treatment", "30/60/90-day program"
   - Approach targets: "trauma-informed care", "participant-centered treatment", "addiction treatment methodology"
   - Ensure meta descriptions and H1s reflect this differentiation

================================================================================
END OF ANALYSIS
================================================================================

This analysis is based on complete readings of the actual pages, not assumptions.
The redundancy is real, but the solution is differentiation, not deletion.

"Our Approach" page has potential to be a valuable clinical credibility builder
if it's rewritten to focus on methodology, not therapy lists.
