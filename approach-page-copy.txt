Healing Through Nature
While our facility is set in the heart of San Jos√© for easy access to medical services and international airports, we believe in the power of nature to support recovery.

Our participants enjoy an organized day trip once a week into Costa Rica‚Äôs breathtaking natural surroundings, where they can reflect and connect with the environment as part of their holistic healing process.
