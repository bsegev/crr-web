CRITICAL OVERLAP ANALYSIS:
⚠️⚠️⚠️ SEVERE REDUNDANCY:

1. WITH HOME PAGE:
   - "Whole person: mind, body, spirit" (exact same language)
   - "Evidence-based + holistic" (repeated verbatim)
   - "Personalized/participant-centered" (same concept)

2. WITH RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM:
   - Treatment Modalities section on Residential lists EXACT SAME therapies:
     * CBT, REBT, DBT (identical on both pages)
     * Yoga, meditation, art therapy, nature (identical on both pages)
   - "Personalized treatment plans" (both pages emphasize)

3. WITH MISSION & VISION:
   - "Whole person" philosophy (repeated)
   - "Evidence-based + holistic" (repeated)

NARRATIVE ISSUES:
- Section 2 ("Treating the Whole Person") and Section 4 ("Healing the Whole Person") are nearly identical in message
- "Your Unique Recovery Path" feels like it should be earlier in the flow
- "Support for Loved Ones" doesn't fit "Our Approach" - should be on Residential Program or separate page
- "Healing Through Nature" elaborates on one holistic method but doesn't fit overall narrative arc

STRATEGIC QUESTIONS:
- What is this page's UNIQUE purpose that Residential Program doesn't serve?
- Is this meant for SEO (targeting "approach" keywords)?
- Should this be folded into Residential Program?
- OR should Residential Program focus on logistics/schedule, and Approach focus on clinical philosophy?


C. PREPARING FOR YOUR STAY PAGE (app/programs/preparing-for-your-stay/page.tsx)
----------
STATUS: NOT YET BUILT

EXPECTED PURPOSE:
- Pre-arrival logistics
- What to pack
- Travel information
- What to expect on Day 1
- Administrative requirements

EXPECTED SEO:
- "what to bring to rehab"
- "preparing for addiction treatment"
- "Costa Rica travel rehab"

EXPECTED OVERLAP:
- Should be minimal - practical logistics only
- Should NOT repeat treatment philosophy

================================================================================

----------
PURPOSE: Convert visitors → leads (phone call or form submission)

----------
PURPOSE: Crisis resources, immediate help information

================================================================================
SECTION 6: SEO KEYWORD OVERLAP ANALYSIS
================================================================================

PRIMARY KEYWORDS (likely shared across multiple pages):
- "addiction treatment Costa Rica"
- "rehab Costa Rica"
- "holistic addiction recovery"
- "evidence-based rehab"

POTENTIAL KEYWORD CANNIBALIZATION:
- Residential Program vs. Our Approach:
  Both targeting "holistic addiction treatment Costa Rica"
  Both targeting "evidence-based addiction therapy"
  
CONCERN: Google may not know which page to rank for these terms

RECOMMENDATION:
- Residential Program should target: "residential addiction program", "inpatient rehab Costa Rica", "30 60 90 day program"
- Our Approach should target: "treatment approach", "addiction therapy methods", "CBT DBT Costa Rica"
- OR: Consolidate into one comprehensive Residential Program page

================================================================================
SECTION 7: USER JOURNEY ANALYSIS
================================================================================

IDEAL USER JOURNEY #1 (Research-oriented visitor):
Home → About/Mission-Vision → Residential Program → Contact
- Wants to understand WHO you are, then WHAT you offer

IDEAL USER JOURNEY #2 (Urgent/crisis visitor):
Home → Get Help → Contact
- Needs immediate action

IDEAL USER JOURNEY #3 (Program comparison visitor):
Home → Residential Program → Review program lengths → Contact
- Shopping/comparing programs

CURRENT ISSUE:
"Our Approach" doesn't fit cleanly into any journey:
- Too philosophical for urgent visitors
- Redundant with Residential Program for detail-seekers
- Doesn't add unique value beyond what's on Residential Program

POTENTIAL VALUE OF "OUR APPROACH":
- Could be valuable for SEO (ranking for "approach" keywords)
- Could serve visitors specifically searching "what is your treatment approach"
- Could be condensed and merged into Residential Program as a subsection

================================================================================
SECTION 8: CONVERSION PATH ANALYSIS
================================================================================

PAGES WITH STRONG CONVERSION DESIGN:
1. Home (multiple CTAs, phone number prominent)
2. Residential Program (clear progression to contact)
3. How To Get Started component (embedded in home)

PAGES WITH WEAK/UNCLEAR CONVERSION:
1. Our Approach - Only 1 mid-page CTA (to Residential Program)
2. Mission & Vision - No mid-page CTAs
3. About landing - Unclear journey

RECOMMENDATION:
Every page needs at least one strong mid-page CTA, not just footer contact

================================================================================
SECTION 9: RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

CRITICAL ISSUES:

1. OUR APPROACH PAGE REDUNDANCY ⚠️⚠️⚠️
   PROBLEM: 80% content overlap with Residential Program + Home + Mission
   OPTIONS:
   A. DELETE and redirect to Residential Program
   B. CONSOLIDATE: Merge into Residential Program as "Our Treatment Approach" section
   C. DIFFERENTIATE: Completely rewrite to focus on clinical philosophy, research, outcomes
   D. REPURPOSE: Make it about "Trauma-Informed Care" or specific clinical methodology that's NOT covered elsewhere

   RECOMMENDATION: Option B or D
   - If Option B: Add "Our Treatment Approach" section to Residential Program, redirect /programs/our-approach → /programs/residential-program
   - If Option D: Rewrite entirely - focus on trauma-informed care, dual diagnosis approach, or another clinical differentiation

2. REDUNDANT MESSAGING ACROSS SITE
   - Reduce repetition of "evidence-based + holistic" - use once on Home, once on Residential
   - "Whole person: mind, body, spirit" should appear on Mission & Vision, not repeated on every page
   - "Personalized care" is your differentiator - keep it, but vary the language

3. TREATMENT MODALITIES DUPLICATION
   - List detailed therapies (CBT, DBT, REBT) ONLY on Residential Program
   - Home can mention "evidence-based therapies" generally
   - Our Approach (if kept) should discuss therapeutic PHILOSOPHY, not list therapies again

4. SEO KEYWORD CANNIBALIZATION
   - Residential Program = target transactional keywords ("30 day rehab", "residential treatment")
   - Our Approach = target informational keywords ("how does addiction treatment work", "what is holistic recovery")
   - Mission & Vision = target brand keywords ("Costa Rica Recovery mission", "who is CRR")

5. NARRATIVE FLOW OF OUR APPROACH (if kept)
   - Move "Your Unique Recovery Path" to position 2 (after hero)
   - Remove "Support for Loved Ones" (move to Residential or Preparing For Your Stay)
   - Consolidate "Treating the Whole Person" and "Healing the Whole Person" into ONE section
   - Add a section on OUTCOMES or RESEARCH (what makes your approach effective?)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:

6. ABOUT LANDING PAGE
   - Likely duplicates content from Mission & Vision
   - Consider making it a hub/navigation page instead of content-heavy

7. ADD MID-PAGE CTAs
   - Mission & Vision: Add CTA after Mission section
   - Our Approach: Add second CTA after therapies section
   - All About pages: Add "Ready to start?" CTA boxes

8. PREPARING FOR YOUR STAY PAGE
   - Build this page (it's pending)
   - Focus ONLY on logistics, what to bring, travel info
   - Do NOT repeat treatment philosophy

LOW PRIORITY:

9. PHONE NUMBER CONSISTENCY
   - Ensure (866) 804-1793 is click-to-call on ALL pages
   - Consider sticky header with phone number on mobile

10. VISUAL CONSISTENCY
   - All program/about pages now use same hero structure (good!)
   - Maintain eyebrow + H2 + body text pattern (good!)

================================================================================
SECTION 10: FINAL VERDICT ON "OUR APPROACH" PAGE
================================================================================

CURRENT STATE: The page is well-designed but strategically unclear.

QUESTIONS TO ANSWER:
1. What does "Our Approach" tell visitors that "Residential Program" doesn't?
   → Currently: Almost nothing unique

2. What user intent does "Our Approach" serve?
   → Currently: Unclear - overlaps with both Home (philosophy) and Residential (tactics)

3. What should someone DO after reading "Our Approach"?
   → Currently: Go to Residential Program (so why not start there?)

4. What search queries should "Our Approach" rank for?
   → Currently: Same as Residential Program (keyword cannibalization risk)

STRATEGIC OPTIONS:

OPTION A: DELETE
- Redirect /programs/our-approach → /programs/residential-program
- Pros: Eliminates redundancy, simplifies user journey
- Cons: Loses potential SEO page, loses "Programs" dropdown link

OPTION B: MERGE INTO RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM
- Add "Our Treatment Approach" section to Residential Program (position 2, after "What is the Residential Program?")
- Keep it brief: Philosophy paragraph + therapy/holistic summary
- Redirect /programs/our-approach → /programs/residential-program#approach
- Pros: Consolidates all program info, maintains SEO value
- Cons: Makes Residential Program longer (but more comprehensive)

OPTION C: DIFFERENTIATE WITH UNIQUE CLINICAL ANGLE
- Completely rewrite "Our Approach" to focus on:
  * Trauma-Informed Care methodology
  * Dual Diagnosis treatment approach
  * Evidence base / research / outcomes data
  * Clinical protocols and medical safety
  * How CRR approach differs from typical rehabs
- Remove therapy/holistic lists (keep those on Residential only)
- Make it a deep-dive on clinical philosophy for research-oriented visitors
- Pros: Creates unique value, serves specific user intent
- Cons: Requires significant content rewrite

OPTION D: REPURPOSE AS "TREATMENT METHODS" OR "THERAPIES" PAGE
- Focus ONLY on explaining each therapy in depth
- Make it educational/SEO content
- Serve visitors searching "what is CBT for addiction", "how does DBT work"
- Pros: Clear SEO purpose, educational value
- Cons: Not a "Programs" page anymore, might fit better in "About" or as standalone

MY RECOMMENDATION: Option C (Differentiate)

WHY:
- You've built a Programs dropdown with 3 intended pages
- "Our Approach" has value if it tells a DIFFERENT story than Residential
- Residential Program = "What is the program?" (logistics, structure, schedule)
- Our Approach = "Why does this work?" (clinical philosophy, trauma-informed care, research)
- Preparing For Your Stay = "How do I get ready?" (practical logistics)

This creates three complementary pages:
- Residential = WHAT (the program structure)
- Our Approach = WHY (the clinical methodology)
- Preparing = HOW (the practical steps)

NEXT STEPS IF OPTION C:
1. Review current "Our Approach" copy from approach-page-copy.txt
2. Identify what's unique vs. redundant
3. Rewrite focusing on clinical differentiation:
   - Lead with trauma-informed care
   - Explain participant-centered model (what does this mean in practice?)
   - Discuss integration of evidence-based + holistic (the WHY, not just the WHAT)
   - Add section on outcomes / success metrics
   - Keep family support (it's about the comprehensive approach)
4. Remove therapy/holistic lists (just reference them, don't duplicate)
5. Make it more philosophical and research-backed, less tactical

================================================================================
END OF AUDIT
================================================================================

SUMMARY:
- Total pages audited: 12+
- Critical redundancy identified: Our Approach vs. Residential Program
- Primary recommendation: Rewrite Our Approach to differentiate (Option C)
- Secondary recommendations: Reduce cross-site redundancy, add mid-page CTAs, fix SEO cannibalization

This audit should inform content strategy going forward.
