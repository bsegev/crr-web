Aftercare Program Overview

How It Works:
Each CRR program participant is paired with a clinical follow-up coordinator before discharge
Individual remote sessions (Zoom/Google Meet) for guidance, accountability, and support

Session frequency tailored by program length:
After 30-Day Program:
2 biweekly sessions over 1 month

After 60-Day Program:
2 sessions in month 1, followed by 1 session in month 2

After 90-Day Program:
2 sessions in months 1 & 2, followed by 1 session in month 3

The purpose is to bridge residential treatment and independent living, as well as to support long-term recovery, personal growth, and relapse prevention

Aftercare Program Focus Areas

Relapse Prevention
Ongoing review and updating of personalized relapse prevention plans

Address barriers to connection and build healthy, supportive relationships

Daily Structure & Purpose
Maintain and adapt healthy routines (work, study, volunteering, self-care)
Promote accountability, stability, and personal growth

Mental & Emotional Health
Ongoing support for emotional regulation, resilience, and stress management
Use of therapeutic tools (journaling, mindfulness, behavioral activation)

Real Transformations

The real proof is in the stories.

“This has been one of the most positive experiences in my life. I had been through rehab before, I left sober, but I never left feeling better.

What initially stood out to me most was the compassion, spread out by everyone in the building. This is a place of joy and healing.

You can hear the laughter and feel the energy when you enter, and it stays with you when you leave.”
— Justin K
