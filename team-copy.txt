Dr. Bryan Alfaro, PhD
Medical Services Director
In Scott Huseby‚Äôs previous career, he led one of the most respected litigation support firms in the United States. Yet beyond his professional success, Scott discovered a deeper purpose after experiencing the healing power of recovery firsthand.

That calling led him to Costa Rica, where he became the owner of Costa Rica Recovery in San Jos√© ‚Äì a holistic, participant-centered haven for individuals seeking freedom from addiction. Scott now uses his leadership and lived experience to walk alongside others on their recovery journey, offering the same hope and healing that changed his life.

October 10th is World Mental Health Day ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π This day is recognized globally to help us all collaborate to improve access to mental health services for those who need it. In recognition of this day, we wanted to encourage you to reach out to someone in your life if you suspect they need support with a mental health challenge. Here are some tips that may guide your conversation: 1. Find a good space to talk without distractions. This will improve the quality of your communication and foster deeper, more honest answers to your questions. 2. Listen and ask questions. Listening can be one of the most valuable ways to be there for someone. Be patient and listen fully to what they‚Äôre saying without changing the subject. 3. Ask how you can help. Ask how you can help rather than making suggestions or telling them what to do next. They might just appreciate being heard, or they may want help getting an appointment with a mental health practitioner ‚Äì let them guide the conversation. As always, we are here to answer your questions about seeking treatment for problematic substance use. Call us at 1 (866) 804-1793 or visit www.costaricarecovery.com for more information.

Cocaine Treatment that is Effective Cocaine (and crack) has unfortunately become widely abused again throughout North America in recent years, due to many factors, one of which is a prevalent supply coming in from Mexico. Unfortunately, due to the potential of the cocaine being contaminated with fentanyl, the risk for a fatal overdose from cocaine use is at an all-time high. Our treatment center in Costa Rica has been helping adults recover from cocaine dependency for over a decade, and the combination of many factors, like our setting and our highly trained clinical staff have earned us the reputation of being very effective in helping people recover from this very addictive drug.
