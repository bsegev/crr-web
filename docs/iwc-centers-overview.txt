MESSAGING FRAMEWORK
==================

Instead of: "Global network of centers"
Say: "Four owned centers across the US and Costa Rica"

Instead of: "International presence"  
Say: "Expanding internationally with owned facilities"

Instead of: "Vast network"
Say: "Carefully selected and owned treatment centers"

Emphasize:
- Direct ownership vs. referral relationships
- Personal investment and oversight
- Authentic Costa Rica presence (not medical tourism)
- Spectrum of care from clinical to holistic
- Family-founded authenticity
- Geographic and cultural diversity

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES
=====================

vs. Large Networks:
- Direct ownership ensures quality control
- No middleman markups or referral fees
- Personal investment in outcomes

vs. Single Centers:
- Multiple options for different needs/budgets
- Geographic diversity for different preferences
- Comprehensive spectrum of care approaches

vs. Medical Tourism:
- Owned facilities, not partnerships
- Cultural authenticity and deep local roots
- Cost advantages passed to patients
- Ongoing oversight and relationship

KEY TRUTH: IWC owns 4 centers that represent a thoughtful spectrum of care - from clinical excellence in California to authentic Costa Rican holistic healing, from accessible pricing to luxury experiences, from addiction treatment to wellness prevention. This isn't about size - it's about intentional curation and direct ownership ensuring ethical, transparent care.
