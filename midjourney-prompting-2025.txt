MIDJOURNEY PROMPTING BEST PRACTICES 2025
=========================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Midjourney v6+ now interprets natural language more effectively than numerical weights.
Focus on descriptive, structured prompts with natural emphasis rather than :: weights.


PROMPT STRUCTURE
----------------
Follow this order for best results:

1. SUBJECT
   - Clearly define the main focus
   - Be specific and detailed
   
2. DETAILED DESCRIPTION
   - Appearance, environment, mood
   - Use rich, descriptive language
   - Include spatial relationships (LEFT SIDE, RIGHT SIDE, foreground, background)
   
3. STYLE REFERENCE
   - Artistic style or medium
   - Reference specific artists or movements if desired
   - Photography style (documentary, cinematic, editorial, etc.)
   
4. LIGHTING
   - Type of light (golden hour, soft diffused, dramatic, natural)
   - Quality and direction of light
   - Mood created by lighting
   
5. CAMERA/TECHNICAL SPECS
   - Perspective and framing
   - Specific camera and lens (pushes toward photorealism)
   - Aperture for depth of field
   
6. PARAMETERS (at the end)
   - --ar [ratio] (aspect ratio: 16:9 for landscape, 4:5 for portrait, 1:1 for square)
   - --stylize [0-1000] or --s [0-1000] (lower = more literal, higher = more artistic)
   - --quality [.25, .5, 1, 2] or --q [value] (higher = more detail, longer generation)


NATURAL LANGUAGE EMPHASIS (replaces numerical weights)
------------------------------------------------------
Instead of using ::5 or ::4 weights, use descriptive emphasis:

STRONG EMPHASIS:
- "STRONGLY EMPHASIZING"
- "prominently showing"
- "clearly visible"
- "notably"
- "powerfully"
- "heavily featured"
- "primarily focused on"

MEDIUM EMPHASIS:
- "featuring"
- "with attention to"
- "highlighting"
- "showcasing"

SUBTLE EMPHASIS:
- "including"
- "with elements of"
- "hints of"
- "subtle touches of"


COMMON PARAMETERS
-----------------
Aspect Ratios:
  --ar 16:9    Desktop hero/banner (landscape)
  --ar 4:5     Mobile-first portrait
  --ar 1:1     Square (social media)
  --ar 2:3     Tall portrait
  --ar 3:2     Traditional photo

Stylization:
  --s 0-100    More photorealistic, literal
  --s 100-300  Balanced (good default range)
  --s 300-500  More artistic interpretation
  --s 500-1000 Highly stylized/artistic

Quality:
  --q .25      Draft/testing (faster)
  --q 1        Standard (default)
  --q 2        High detail (recommended for final)


PHOTOGRAPHY-SPECIFIC TIPS
--------------------------
For photorealistic results, include:
- Specific camera model (Canon EOS R5, Sony A7IV, Nikon Z9)
- Lens specs (35mm, 50mm, 85mm, 24-70mm)
- Aperture (f/1.4, f/1.8, f/2.8, etc.)
- Photography style (documentary, editorial, cinematic, portrait)
- Lighting type (natural light, golden hour, studio lighting)

Example: "shot on Canon EOS R5, 50mm prime lens, f/1.8, natural lighting"


WHAT TO AVOID
-------------
❌ Numerical weights (::5, ::4, ::2) - outdated syntax
❌ Overly complex nested parameters
❌ Vague descriptions ("beautiful," "nice," "good")
❌ Too many conflicting style references
❌ Extremely long prompts (diminishing returns after ~300 words)


EXAMPLE PROMPT TEMPLATE
------------------------
[SUBJECT]: A [specific subject description]
[DETAILS]: [detailed appearance], [environment/setting], [mood/emotion], [spatial relationships]
[STYLE]: in the style of [artistic reference], [medium/technique]
[LIGHTING]: [lighting type and quality], [direction and mood]
[CAMERA]: shot on [camera model], [lens], [aperture]
--ar [ratio] --s [stylization] --q [quality]


REAL EXAMPLE
------------
Two versions of the same person standing face to face in a sunlit Costa Rican hotel room, 
STRONGLY EMPHASIZING the transformation between them, LEFT SIDE prominently showing: the person 
wearing casual wrinkled clothes with tired exhausted expression, slouched defeated posture, 
heavy dark circles under eyes, disheveled appearance, looking down with worried face, notably 
muted desaturated colors, RIGHT SIDE prominently showing: the exact same person wearing fresh 
clean casual clothes, bright peaceful expression with gentle smile, confident upright posture, 
healthy glowing skin, hopeful eyes looking forward, notably warm vibrant colors, natural golden 
hour lighting streaming powerfully between them creating dramatic separation, tropical greenery 
and large windows with Costa Rican landscape clearly visible in background, cinematic split 
composition with clear visual divide, authentic documentary photography style, rich depth and 
dimension, professional portraiture with emotional weight, genuine human transformation, shot on 
Canon EOS R5, 50mm prime lens, f/1.8, photorealistic quality --ar 16:9 --s 350 --q 2


ITERATION TIPS
--------------
1. Start with a clear, simple prompt
2. Generate and review results
3. Add specific details to refine
4. Adjust stylization if too artistic or too literal
5. Use remix mode to make variations
6. Save successful prompt patterns for reuse


COMMON USE CASES
----------------
Hero Images (website headers):
  - --ar 16:9, --s 200-400, --q 2
  - Emphasize mood and environment
  - Include "cinematic," "professional photography"

Product Photography:
  - --ar 4:5 or 1:1, --s 50-150, --q 2
  - Clean backgrounds, good lighting
  - Specific camera specs for realism

Portraits:
  - --ar 4:5 or 2:3, --s 150-300, --q 2
  - Focus on emotion and lighting
  - Shallow depth of field (f/1.4-2.8)

Lifestyle/Editorial:
  - --ar 16:9 or 4:5, --s 250-400, --q 2
  - Natural settings, authentic moments
  - Documentary style language
